# GA-Project1-Wordle

Wordle for GA Project1
[Here is my Wordle Game!(https://lyrefox.github.io/GA-Project1-Wordle/html/)

## Rules
- You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less
- A correct letter turns green
- A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow
- An incorrect letter turns gray
- Letters can be used more than once
- Answers are never plurals

## Work Plan
- [✅] Create HTML
- [✅] Create CSS
- [✅] js

- I pretty much accomplished all my goals using for loops, arrays and if statements mainly. 

- Unsolved problems - Everything works but I was not able to figure out how to remove duplicate yellows when there is no duplicate in the correct word.
